# DXPlot
#### Graph Plotter Built entirely using DirectX 11
#### This is an initial demo for the game engine this would eventually turn into

## Instructions
#### Run copydll.bat after build if you encounter LINK errors, in case that doesn't solve the issue, you'll have to recompile the libraries and place them in "libs/"
